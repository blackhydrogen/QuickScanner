# QuickScanner
A faster alternative to java.util.Scanner. While QuickScanner does not provide the same variety/number of methods similiar to the original Scanner class, it provides decent coverage for most (competitive programming) situations.

##Quick Start (read from Standard Input):
```
QuickScanner scanner = new QuickScanner(System.in);

int    myInt    = scanner.nextInt();
long   myLong   = scanner.nextLong();
double myDouble = scanner.nextDouble();
String myString = scanner.next();
String myLine   = scanner.nextLine();
```
